This Trackerlist is intendet to list all domains i wouldn't allow in NoScript because their Resources aren't required for the page to fulfill th users need, but are only used to track them or deliver ads.
I will use it in my Routers Blacklist (Fritz!Box) to block Ads and Trackers on every Device in my local Network.

Parts of the list of Ad-Domains is derived from http://pgl.yoyo.org/as/serverlist.php?hostformat=nohtml&amp;showintro=1&amp;mimetype=plaintext
